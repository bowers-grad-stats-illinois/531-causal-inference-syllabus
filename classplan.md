From Morgan and Winship:

> The frequency of basic confounding has established subgroup analysis as perhaps the most common modeling strategy to prosecute causal questions in social science research. Whether referred to as subclassification, stratification, tabular decomposi- tion, or simply adjustment for a third variable, the data are analyzed after “condi- tioning” on membership in groups defined by values of the confounder variable.
