\section*{\faBook\ Overview}

We infer what we cannot observe. Last term you engaged with the problems of
choosing better or worse descriptions of what we actually observe in data, and
also with the problems of statistical inference --- where we discussed better
and worse ways to learn about descriptions of phenomenon that we cannot
directly observe using tools like estimators and tests. Whether an estimator or
a test was a good one or bad one depended on assumptions that we had to make
about the process of observation. For example, we learned that a randomized
experiment and/or a random sample allows us to trust that our estimators are
unbiased and tests have controlled false positive error rates.

This term we dive deeper in the different approaches that statisticians and
methodologists have developed to make causal inferences.\footnote{I encourage
you to check out classes on sampling in order to go deeper into population
inference and classes on measurement and psychometrics in order to go deeper
into measurement inference.} When we say "causal inference" in this course we
are really talking about making statistical inferences that we feel comfortable
interpreting as reflecting counterfactual causal effects.\footnote{We recommend
you checkout \textcite{waldner2025book} to learn more about causal inference that
does not involve statistical inference directly.}

What we will see is that ``statistical inference for counterfactual causal
quantities" aka ``causal inference" requires more assumptions than statistical
inference alone. The fact that we have to make assumptions is not in and of
itself a problem. However, more assumptions require more scrutiny. By the end
of the course, I hope that you feel confident choosing, using and scrutinizing
assumptions to enable you to make causal inferences from data and designs that
help you advance understanding of politics and society in your substantive
work.

\pdfbookmark[1]{Learning Objectives}{objectives}
\section*{\faBullseye\ Learning Objectives}

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]

  \item Articulate the fundamental problem of causal inference and distinguish
    causal from descriptive research questions

  \item Design and analyze basic randomized experiments, including power
    analysis.

  \item Understand, implement, interpret, and evaluate causal inferences that
    depend on adjusting for confounders (including matching and parametric
    adjustment)
  
  \item Understand, implement, interpret, and evaluate causal inferences that
    depend on instrumental variables and other discontinuities (RDD)

  \item Understand, implement, interpret, and evaluate causal inferences that
    depend on assumptions about how outcomes change over time in panel data.

\end{itemize}

    To these ends I have designed a series of activities that should (1)
    give you opportunities to practice working with data and reasoning
    about statistics and (2) raise questions for discussion each week.

    \textbf{I do not lecture.} Rather, each week we will meet to engage with the
    questions that you have.

    \pdfbookmark[2]{Explorations}{explorations}
    \subsection*{Explorations}

    Every week or so, I will ask you to complete a short assignment that
    encourages you to engage creatively with the topics of that section of the
    course. I anticipate that you will work on most of these assignments in
    groups and a few alone  and that each of you will come to class prepared to
    discuss them.  I don't think that the groups should have more than 3 people
    in them. However, I'm willing to have larger groups if you talk with me
    about it. The point of the explorations is for you to (1) practice learning
    on your own (making mistakes, confronting confusing error messages, finding
    help online and elsewhere) and in a group (this is how you will learn about
    statistics for the rest of your career, so these explorations are supposed
    to help you to practice it now), (2) engage with the topic of the week so
    that you are prepared to come to class with questions and ideas, (3)
    practice coding and confronting coding errors.

    \pdfbookmark[2]{Final projects}{finalprojects}
    \subsection*{Final projects}

    Each of you will produce a short replication paper by the end of the
    term.\footnote{The idea comes from
        \href{https://gking.harvard.edu/papers}{Gary King's assignment to his
        first year PhD students}. I encourage you read that website and
        associated paper in which King explains his ideas. Our version will differ
    a little from his.} The idea is to practice using your new skills and concepts
    as applied to a topic of interest to you --- but in a very targeted way. The
    idea is to understand what someone else did in the past, and perhaps to improve
    upon it now.

    You should find a paper that uses statistical methods that you are willing
    to work to understand this term and where the data are available (ideally
    the data are easy to download, you can also contact the author of the paper
    after discussion with me).

    You are allowed to do this work with a co-author or alone as you see fit.

    I will be providing more detailed guidance about this assignment as the
    term goes on.

    \pdfbookmark[2]{My Expectations}{expectations}
    \subsection*{My Expectations}

    \begin{enumerate}

        \item I assume you are eager to learn. Eagerness, curiosity and
            excitement will impel your energetic engagement with the class
            throughout the term. If you are bored, not curious, or unhappy
            about the class you should come and talk with me immediately.
            Energetic engagement manifests itself in meeting with your
            classmates outside of the class, in asking questions during the
            class, and in taking the assignments seriously.

        \item I assume you are ready to work. Learning requires work. As much as
            possible I will encourage you to link practice directly to application
            rather than merely as a opportunity for me to rank you among your peers.
            Making work about learning rather than ranking, however, will make our work
            that much more difficult and time consuming. You will make errors. These
            errors are opportunities for you to learn --- some of your learning will be
            about how to help yourself and some will be about statistics. If you have
            too much to do this term consider dropping the course. Graduate
            school is a place for you to develop and begin to pursue your own
            intellectual agendas: this course may be important for you this term, or it
            may not. That is up for you to decide.

        \item  I assume some previous engagement with high school mathematics.

        \item You should ask questions when you don't understand things;
            chances are you're not alone.  \textbf{This class is an opportunity
            to practice courage:} I expect you to make a guess when I ask a
            question (in writing or in person), I expect that you will ask a
            question when you have a problem.

        \item \textbf{Do the work.} This does not mean divide the work up among
            your classmates so that you only do part of the work. Each person
            should engage with all of the work even if the people who writes it
            up changes from week to week.

        \item 	All papers written in this class will assume familiarity with
            the principles of good writing in \textcite{beck:1986}.

        \item 	All final written work will be turned in as pdf files unless we have another
            specific arrangement.\footnote{For example, if you have some reason why pdf
                files make your life especially difficult, then of course I will work with
            you find another format.} I will not accept Microsoft, Apple, or any other
            proprietary format.
    \end{enumerate}

    \pdfbookmark[2]{Late Work}{latework}
    \subsection*{Late Work}
    I do not like evaluation for the sake of evaluation. Evaluation should
    provide opportunities for learning. So, if you'd prefer to spend
    more time using the paper assignment in this class to learn more, I am
    happy for you to take that time. I will not, however, entertain late
    submissions for any subsidiary paper assignments or other homeworks that are due
    throughout the term. If you think that you and/or the rest of the
    class have a compelling reason to change the due date on one of those
    assignments, let me know in advance and I will probably just change
    the due date for the whole class.

    \pdfbookmark[2]{Incompletes}{incompletes}
    \subsection*{Incompletes} Incomplete grades at the end of the term are fine
    in theory but terrible in practice. I urge you to avoid an incomplete in
    this class. If you must take an incomplete, you must give me \emph{at
    least} 2 months from the time of turning in an incomplete before you can
    expect a grade from me and it may well take me much longer. This means that
    if your fellowship, immigration status, or job depends on erasing an
    incomplete in this class, you should not leave this incomplete until the
    last minute.

    \pdfbookmark[2]{Grades are Feedback}{grades}
    \subsection*{Grades are Feedback}

    Humans need feedback to close the gap between  intention and action. They
    also need feedback to feel good about their progress and to motivate them.
    In this class I will use grades as feedback. All grades except for the
    final grade will be satisfactory, unsatisfactory (with the possibility of
    "outstanding"), and fail. These map roughly onto  A+=outstanding,
    A=satisfactory, C=unsatisfactory, and F=fail (i.e. you didn't try).

    I'll calculate your grade for the course this way: 30\% daily R (you have 5
    days out of every 7 to turn it in, no late work accepted, satisfactory if
    you turned it in, fail if you didn't turn it in); 40\% explorations (when
    you turn it in as a group everyone in the group receives the same grade,
    satisfactory if you are creative and thoughtful and diligent,
    unsatisfactory if you are not or if you don't seem to be getting the
    concepts, no late work accepted); 20\% replication paper; 10\% attendance
    (satisfactory if you show up, fail if not).

    You can miss two classes without grade penalty.

    I will drop your lowest exploration grade as well.

    Because moments of evaluation are also moments of learning in this
    class, I do not curve. If you all perform at 100\%, then I will give
    you all As.

    You can redo any  evaluation or the final paper in order  to  increase
    your grade on that  assignment. If you want to resubmit something already
    graded, you need  to let me know  in advance so that  I  can make  time to
    grade it again. If you want to resubmit work after the end of the term,
    that is also ok, but I may take many months to grade that work.

    \pdfbookmark[2]{Books}{books}
    \subsection*{Books}

    No book is perfect for all students. I suggest you ask around, look at
    other syllabi online, and just browse the shelves at the library and used
    bookstores to find books that make things clear to you.  I will be adding
    some recommendations here. Let me know now if you have favorites.

    If you discover any books or websites that are particularly useful to you,
    please alert me and the rest of the class about them. Thanks!

    \pdfbookmark[2]{Academic Integrity}{integrity}
    \subsection*{Academic Integrity} According to the Student Code, `It is
    the responsibility of each student to refrain from infractions of
    academic integrity, from conduct that may lead to suspicion of such
    infractions, and from conduct that aids others in such infractions.’
    Please know that it is my responsibility as an instructor to uphold the
    academic integrity policy of the University, which can be found here:
