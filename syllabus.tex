\section*{\faBook\ Course Description}

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to causal inference methods for political science research. We will explore the fundamental problem of causal inference, experimental and quasi-experimental designs, and modern statistical techniques for estimating causal effects from observational data. The course emphasizes both theoretical foundations and practical application, with students learning to critically evaluate causal claims and conduct their own causal analyses.

Topics include randomized experiments, matching methods, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity designs, difference-in-differences, synthetic control methods, and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Students will gain hands-on experience implementing these methods using statistical software and applying them to real-world political science questions.

\section*{\faBullseye\ Learning Objectives}

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Articulate the fundamental problem of causal inference and distinguish causal from descriptive research questions
  \item Design and analyze randomized experiments, including power analysis and blocking strategies
  \item Apply matching methods to estimate causal effects from observational data
  \item Implement and interpret instrumental variable analyses
  \item Conduct regression discontinuity and difference-in-differences analyses
  \item Use directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to reason about causal relationships and confounding
  \item Critically evaluate causal claims in published research
  \item Conduct original causal inference analyses using R or Stata

\textbf{Midterm Exam} & 25\% \\
\textbf{Final Research Paper} & 25\% \\
\textbf{Class Participation} & 10\% \\
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{Problem Sets}
Four problem sets will be assigned throughout the semester, combining theoretical questions with applied data analysis. Students may work in groups of up to three but must submit individual write-ups. Problem sets are due at the beginning of class on the assigned date.

\subsection*{Midterm Exam}
A take-home midterm exam will be distributed in Week 8 and due one week later. The exam will cover material from the first half of the course and test both conceptual understanding and analytical skills.

\subsection*{Final Research Paper}
Students will write a research paper (15-20 pages) that applies causal inference methods to a substantive political science question. The paper should include a clear research question, literature review, description of data and methods, results, and discussion. A proposal is due in Week 10, and the final paper is due during finals week.

\subsection*{Class Participation}
Active participation in class discussions, including presenting and critiquing research designs, is expected. Students should come prepared to discuss the assigned readings.
