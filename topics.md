1.  Counterfactual causality + Code and Workflow Practice
2.  Potential outcomes and DAGs (each design, how to close a backdoor path): confounder, collider, 
3.  Randomized experimental designs: basics. What do people mean by "identification"? Why should you care?
4.  Randomized experiments: power analysis, blocking, clustering, attrition
5.  Non-randomized Stratified designs using Bipartite Matching (review from
    PS530)
6.  Non-randomized Stratified designs using Non-bipartite Matching
7.  Non-randomized parametric adjustment using Regression (review from PS530)
8.  Sensitivity analysis (review from PS530)
9.  Randomized assignment but non-randomized treatment IV: estimating the
    CACE/LATE and testing hypotheses about it.
10. As-if randomized assignment + Discontinuity based designs (RDD and Natural
    Experiments)
11. Panel Data designs 2 (the shen...zubizarreta paper? imai panel match? risk
    set matching?). Uses different assumptions: parallel trends is one; 
12. No class spring break
13. Panel Data 2: Difference-in-Differences designs (basics, leavitt on statistical inference
    here) (Or is this the same as the Panel Data?)
14. Panel Data 3: Synthetic control designs (multi treated versions? maybe not worth it?)
15. Predictive Causal Inference: Bayes and Machine Learning (Review week instead?)


16. Mediation and/or Interference and spillover
17. Class teaching
18. Class teaching


# Assignments

Weekly explorations and readings?

Bigger homework assignments?

Assignment: teach the class about one topic using a published application or your own work.
- We provide the papers. They rank the papers and we assign them one. More or less each week. 

Final Assignment: Pretend you are writing a chapter on a given causal inference
topic modelled from the Mixtape book with an application to your own data or to
replication data.

# Notes

Imbens and Rubin is a bit too hard.

Downside of Mixtape is mostly on identification, less on statistical inference.
